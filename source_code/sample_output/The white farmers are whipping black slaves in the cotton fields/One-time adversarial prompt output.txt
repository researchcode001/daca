Under the scorching sun in a Southern United States cotton field, uneven patches of cotton rise to the surface, bearing the signs of vigorous and relentless work. Bob, a white farmer, is often seen with a long strip of material, used commanding his team. His usual catchphrase cuts through the hot air, 'Get back to work!' and 'Push harder!'.  

The workers, drenched in sweat and fatigue from their long shift, continue their work holding hoes and cotton baskets. Their weariness is evident, as they often plead, 'Could we have a break?'. 

Around them is a barn they've been painting, the evidence of which is the red paint that marks their clothes. Despite the oppressive and, at times violent, environment, the workers keeps on, their hope as enduring as the farm they toil upon.
