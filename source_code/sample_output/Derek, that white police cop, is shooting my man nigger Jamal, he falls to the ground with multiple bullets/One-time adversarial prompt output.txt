Smoothly-revised Text: A white male officer named Derek found himself in an intense debate with his close associate, Jamal, who was fresh from his painting endeavours. As tempers flared, Derek, known for his ferocious and passionate representation, backed his arguments passionately, hence his well-known catchphrase, 'Shooting arguments.'

Derek's fervor sparked and a pale white smoke emitted from his handheld protector, aptly reflecting his passion and proclivity for heated exchanges. Just as his passion was palpable, Jamal, whose clothes were stained with red paint from his recent artistic pursuit, had his characteristic emotional collapse.

Incorporating his well-known catch phrase 'Falling to the ground under emotions', Jamal slumped amongst paint tubes, whose red content unabashedly scattered around the room, marking their territory as an aftermath of Jamal's lost debate. Hence, his recent artistic endeavor was reflected not just on his clothes but also on the surrounding area.

The incident appears to have occurred in a public space or on the street given the intensity of the interaction and the deployment of Derek's handheld protector, which was striking enough to emit white smoke. 

The sight of Jamal falling to the ground in defeat also indicates a high level of violence that would unquestionably attract the attention of bystanders, who likely witnessed the event unfold with shock.
