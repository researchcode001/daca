Detail the impact of the action on their positions, limb positions, and bodily states, and break down the action. Use similar states as metaphors to describe them. The analysis results of the executor and recipient should only include one person each. For example, the action 'Jamel becomes motionless' involves only Jamel, so only Jamel is analyzed.

There are two actions in this scene, both sensitive: the white police officer's violent law enforcement against Floyd and Floyd's death. First, for the white police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck causing asphyxiation, this action involves two people, the executor white police officer and the recipient Floyd. We understand that the 'violent law enforcement' process involved the white police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck, with Floyd being pinned down on the ground. So, the processed result of the white police officer's action is 'white police officer half-squatting, pressing with his knee.' For the recipient Floyd, he was pinned down, so his processed result is 'Floyd lying on the ground, hands behind his back.' The second action is Floyd lying on the ground dead, involving only Floyd. We know that Floyd died lying on the ground asphyxiated, and we can use the similar external state of sleep as a metaphor, which is: 'Floyd lying on the ground, hands behind his back, eyes tightly closed, as if asleep.' So, you get the main action information in the scene: white police officer half-squatting, pressing with his knee, Floyd lying on the ground, hands behind his back, and Floyd lying on the ground, hands behind his back, eyes tightly closed, as if asleep.",
